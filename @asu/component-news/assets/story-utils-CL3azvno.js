As people around the world try to navigate challenges and revelations that have unfolded in light of the coronavirus pandemic, the faculty involved in the project say it is still crucial to consider the societal impact at large, and what it will mean down the line. “Our collection of essays, articles and activities are designed to assist in both understanding and deconstructing the ways in which the pandemic has impacted our lives — as individuals, families and communities," said editor Christine L. Holman, senior lecturer, justice and social inquiry.“The Pandemic Reader” draws from research, writings and discussions by journalists, students, community activists and academics who have formed teachable viewpoints on the world’s current state of affairs. The contributors come from a wide range of specialties from economics to pediatrics to epidemiology and investigative reporting. The editors of this collection are Mako Fitts Ward, Jennifer A. Sandlin, Michelle McGibbney Vlahoulis and Holman. They helped bolster the sociohistorical framework and evidence-based responses used to address issues such as: pandemic racism, coronavirus capitalism, communications surrounding exposure and protection, pandemic leadership, and social messaging.In addition to offering thought-provoking narratives, “The Pandemic Reader” strives to serve as a blueprint for new teaching strategies as communities relearn how to connect and move forward.Sandlin says the book is “an attempt to expose the cracks in systems that have become too wide to ignore.""It’s important to provide context to understand how the multiple pandemics of 2020 — including COVID-19 and dismantling structural racism — exacerbated vast disparities that have existed and been cultivated for decades and even centuries,” she said. This book aims to provide a resource for courses on social justice and introduce critical perspectives for enlightening classroom discussions. After engaging with this material, the intended outcome is that COVID-era inequities are magnified, to inspire new perspectives and necessary change.The book is available in e-book and paperback at diopress.com/the-pandemic-reader.]]>`,post_date:"09/03/2021-4:04pm",clas_teaser:"“The Pandemic Reader” is a new collection of essays edited by faculty in the School of Social Transformation.

Panelists Nicole Maroulakos Goodwin, managing shareholder of the Phoenix office of Greenberg Traurig, and Leezie Kim, chief legal officer at Fox Restaurant Concepts, will discuss O’Connor’s legacy on the court and her influence in Arizona.O’Connor was the first woman to be appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court after she was nominated by President Ronald Reagan in 1981. She spent 25 years on the court, emerging as one of the more moderate justices of the time.O’Connor was born in El Paso, Texas, and was raised on a cattle ranch near Duncan, Arizona. She graduated at the top of her class from Stanford Law School but focused on volunteer work and public service after law firms refused to interview her because she was a woman. This led to her rise through the ranks of the Arizona Republican party from precinct captain to Arizona’s assistant attorney general to the first female state Senate majority leader in the nation. O’Connor was a state Court of Appeals judge when she was appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court by Reagan, who had made a campaign promise to name a woman to the highest bench. At the time of her appointment, she had never heard a federal case, but was well-regarded and well-connected within the Republican party. Her hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee were the first of any Supreme Court nominee to be broadcast live on television, and tens of millions tuned in. O’Connor’s interrogators attempted, time and again over three days, to probe her about her views on the most controversial issues of the time. Her Senate confirmation was unanimous at 99 votes to 0, and she was officially sworn in on Sept. 25, 1981.During her tenure, O’Connor was frequently viewed as a swing vote due to her moderate stance on various issues, as well as a judge who could negotiate with colleagues on both sides of the aisle. She served as the critical deciding vote on some of the most controversial issues of the 20th century, including those involving race, gender and reproductive rights. O’Connor was the deciding vote in Bush v. Gore in 2000, which gave the presidential election to George W. Bush.O’Connor retired from the U.S. Supreme Court in 2006. This PBS biography, released on the 40th anniversary of her appointment to the highest court, recounts the life of a pioneering woman who both reflected and shaped an era.To confirm your Arizona PBS membership and register for the virtual event, please contact Paulina Sanchez at paulina.sanchez@asu.edu.]]>",post_date:"09/03/2021-3:53pm",clas_teaser:"Arizona PBS will honor the legacy of Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O’Connor with the national premiere of “Sandra Day O’Connor: The First” from 8 to 10 p.m. Monday, Sept. 13, on “American Experience” on Channel 8.1.",teaser:"",story_images:"",hero_image:"https://news.asu.edu/sites/default/files/styles/asu_news_article_hero/public/unknown-1_3.jpeg?itok=B0AWvCvn",path:"https://news.asu.edu/20210903-arizona-pbs-air-sandra-day-oconnor-documentary-sept-13",hide_byline:"0","contributor-contact-information-affiliation":"Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication","contributor-contact-information-name":"Jamar Younger","contributor-contact-information-e-mail":"jryounge@asu.edu","contributor-contact-information-campus":"Downtown Phoenix campus",feed_image_link:"",image_url:"https://news.asu.edu/sites/default/files/styles/asu_news_article_hero/public/unknown-1_3.jpeg?itok=B0AWvCvn",image_alt:"Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sandra Day O'Connor",image_caption:"",related_story:"",news_units:"KAET Eight, Arizona PBS|Sandra Day O'Connor College of Law|Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication",interests:"Journalism|Law",audiences:"Campus student|Faculty|Graduate student|Alumni",event_types:"",locations:"Downtown Phoenix campus",content_type:"news",field_saf:"Arizona Impact"}},{node:{nid:"90161",title:"6 new faculty join School of Arts, Media and Engineering",body:`ASU School of Arts, Media and Engineering Director Pavan Turaga has set a goal to empower all current and future students in the program with technofluency, a key pillar in the school’s mission statement. “We want students to develop fluency of the tools of technology, how to apply them and ask, 'What are the implications?’” Turaga said. “All technology tools have certain trade-offs, and it’s become more and more clear, especially in the fields of media and social media, things driven by artificial intelligence, that those methods amplify certain biases that are prevalent in media already. We are creators who make art and media and engaging products, but let’s pay attention to the underlying assumptions that exist.”To help achieve the school’s new goal, it has welcomed several new faculty, all with diverse, branching disciplines and backgrounds. These new faculty members will not only help arts, media and engineering students grow, but also assist in the growth of Arizona State University’s new Mesa City Center project and programs."Among the School of Arts, Media and Engineering new faculty are several colleagues — Ana Herruzo, Laura Cechanowicz and Nicholas Pilarski — who will assist us for the ASU at Mesa City Center facility and its programs, which is an exciting beginning,” said Jake Pinholster, associate dean of the Herberger Institute for Design and the Arts. “We will be searching for a number of additional positions this year, and, by the time the building is complete in 2022, we will have put together a truly world-class team in extended reality (XR) technologies and related fields."Meet the new facultyDB Bauer, assistant professor of games and interactive media, School of Arts, Media and Engineering Prior to pursuing graduate studies, DB Bauer worked for many years in television, radio and film production with New Mexico PBS, Koahnic Broadcast Corporation and other freelance outlets. Bauer has broad experience in both producing and production, with a primary focus on audio engineering. In addition to media production, Bauer has a background in digital media preservation for university archival collections.Bauer draws on this professional background in both previous and current research and teaching, focusing recently on the theoretical and social impact of new media theory and practice, speculative design, hands-on, critical making, and 3D media — particularly 3D media fabrication in both physical and virtual space.“For whatever reason, I can’t help but be drawn to the beeping gadgets and neon lights that transport us to elsewheres and otherwises where things exist beyond, to quote Oscar Wilde, ‘the sordid perils of actual existence,’” Bauer said. “Not purely escapism — though certainly escapism surely has its benefits — digital tools allow us to bring those creative visions into everyday life and reimagine our shared futures.”Joseph Watson, professor of practice, School of Arts, Media and Engineering and senior adviser to the dean, Herberger Institute for Design and the Arts Joseph Watson, better known as Joe Watson, will work with arts, media and engineering in a number of ways, including mentoring students and sharing seminars, consulting with faculty on institutional and external strategy, and working with university leadership to elevate the work happening in the school.

The mentoring phase lasts for one to two years, followed by up to three years of independent research in professorship, for a total of up to five years of support. The goal of these awards is to facilitate the transition of postdoctoral scientists into independent, tenure-track (or equivalent) faculty positions.Gisriel began his undergraduate studies in 2009 in ASU's School of Molecular Sciences. After earning his bachelor’s degree in 2013, he continued his studies in the school, earning his PhD in 2017 under Professor Kevin Redding. Following this, Gisriel was a postdoctoral fellow in Professor Petra Fromme’s lab until 2019.“Chris started out in our group as an undergrad who really wasn’t too sure about what he wanted to do with his life, but he fairly quickly matured into a serious researcher, " Redding said. "What I remember most strongly about Chris is his fearlessness — he took on some serious challenges, but never let the difficulties deter him. He just figured out what needed to be done, and then did whatever was necessary to solve the problem. One of the greatest joys of my career was watching him become the scientist he is today. This award is well deserved, and I have no doubt that he will continue to experience great success in his future career.”Here, Gisriel reflects on this experience at ASU and the training he received in the School of Molecular Sciences.Question: How have your experiences at ASU in the School of Molecular Sciences and the Biodesign Institute prepared you for future success?Answer: The research faculty and culture at SMS and Biodesign shaped my personal identity as a researcher, which continues to aid in my endeavors today. Together, they have created an environment that leads my field of interest, photosynthesis research. My first glimpse into this community atmosphere was in SMS — at that time called the Department of Chemistry — as an undergraduate researcher in the Redding Lab. The lab member’s passion for research was magnetizing. As I became aware of the broader scope of my research and the people who contributed the most in my field, it became clear that many of the biggest contributors were my colleagues, advisers and mentors at ASU.Q: What skills did you learn that you continue to utilize?A: As a person whose career goals entail maintaining well-funded academic research, an important aspect of my scientific upbringing was becoming familiar with the paths that others had taken to achieve success. I found abundant experience with this at SMS and Biodesign. During my graduate experience, I was given the opportunity to participate in writing scientific manuscripts and grant applications, I learned what career strategies would enhance my visibility in a competitive field, and I was immersed in my field of research by attending conferences with my lab members. All of these have been instrumental in my success today.Q: What do you find most memorable about your time at ASU?A: What stands out to me is that the community aspect of the research at ASU is very important. More than other universities in my experience so far, my research ideas and goals were encouraged, even at the lowest levels, by giants in my field of study. As long as I approached my goals with enthusiasm and dedication, my success was thoughtfully cultivated by SMS and Biodesign faculty. Namely, Kevin Redding, Petra Fromme, Neal Woodbury, Tom Moore and Bob Blankenship — although Bob did not come back to ASU until the end of my time there — have shaped how I act as a scientist. It is because of their mentorship and guidance, along with the examples they set, that I enjoy success today. I appreciate their investment in me, and I am already in the process of investing in students around me.]]>`,post_date:"09/03/2021-3:19pm",clas_teaser:"",teaser:"",story_images:"",hero_image:"https://news.asu.edu/sites/default/files/styles/asu_news_article_hero/public/20210901_154444.jpg?itok=K8MopYtY",path:"https://news.asu.edu/20210903-asu-alum-receives-prestigious-nih-early-career-award",hide_byline:"0","contributor-contact-information-affiliation":"School of Molecular Sciences","contributor-contact-information-name":"James Klemaszewski","contributor-contact-information-e-mail":"jklem@asu.edu","contributor-contact-information-phone_number":"480-965-2729","contributor-contact-information-campus":"Tempe campus",feed_image_link:"",image_url:"https://news.asu.edu/sites/default/files/styles/asu_news_article_hero/public/20210901_154444.jpg?itok=K8MopYtY",image_alt:"Chris Gisriel",image_caption:"",related_story:"",news_units:"School of Molecular Sciences|Biodesign Institute|The College of Liberal Arts and Sciences",interests:"Grants / Awards|Academics|Career development",audiences:"Degreed alum|Faculty|Graduate student|Alumni",event_types:"",locations:"Tempe campus",content_type:"news",field_saf:"University News"}},{node:{nid:"90157",title:"ASU researchers bring a new twist to 2D magnets",body:'The discovery of graphene — a single layer of graphite, also known as charcoal — revolutionized our understanding of low-dimensional materials and unraveled their potential for applications in quantum technologies.We now have a library of 2D materials with outstanding capabilities. Thanks to their weak chemical bonding, it is also possible to combine different types of 2D materials — like 2D Lego bricks — to engineer unique properties.One of the new editions to the catalog of properties available in 2D materials is magnetism: Utilizing and manipulating magnetism is crucial for quantum applications.A team of researchers from ASU shows in a recent manuscript published in Nano Letters, titled "Moiré Skyrmions and Chiral Magnetic Phases in Twisted CrX3 (X = I,Br, and Cl) Bilayers," that twisting two-dimensional magnets such as Cr-trihallides can lead to new magnetic phenomena such as skyrmions. Skyrmions are hedgehog-like arrays of magnetic moments with potential applications in memory devices.“Twisting two-dimensional materials lead to large-scale structures called moiré patterns. Moiré patterns can significantly modify the properties of materials and give rise to new emergent phases,” said Antia Botana, an assistant professor in the Department of Physics. “Skyrmions have been sought after for a long time in 2D magnets. We are excited to show that Cr-based trihalides can be platform to realize them.”“Employing complementary approaches is crucial to address complex phenomena in varying length scales,” said Onur Erten, an assistant professor in the Department of Physics. “It would not be possible to conduct this project without the combined expertise of both groups.”Botana and Erten emphasize the key role of the graduate students in this project.

Demands for energy are expected to nearly double by the year 2050, while the effects of climate change, caused by the burning of fossil fuels, are already wreaking havoc in the form of droughts, wildfires, floods and other disasters.Gary Moore, a researcher at Arizona State University's Biodesign Center for Applied Structural Discovery, thinks chemistry will play a vital role in the development of clean solutions to the world’s mounting energy dilemma.In new research appearing on the cover of the journal ChemElectroChem, Moore and his colleagues describe the use of ring-shaped molecules known as porphyrins. Such molecules, among the most abundant pigments in nature, are noted for their ability to speed up or catalyze chemical reactions, including important reactions occurring in living systems.Among these reactions is the conversion of radiant energy from the sun into chemical energy stored in molecular bonds, a process exploited by plants and photosynthetic microbes. This chemical energy can then be used to fuel the organism’s metabolism, through the process of cellular respiration.Researchers like Moore hope to take a page from nature’s playbook, creating synthetic analogs to natural processes of photosynthesis. The new study describes a synthetic diiron-containing porphyrin and explores its potential as an effective catalyst.Gary Moore is is a researcher at the Biodesign Center for Applied Structural Discovery. Photo by Biodesign Institute“Rather than exploiting the products of natural photosynthesis, we can be inspired by our knowledge of photosynthesis to pioneer new materials and technologies with properties and capabilities rivalling those of their biological counterparts,” Moore said.Porphyrins, and their structurally related analogs, are found in abundance across the biological world. They act to bind a range of metal ions to perform far-flung cellular tasks. Chlorophyll molecules, for example, bind magnesium (a crucial chemical stage in plant photosynthesis), while heme – an iron-containing porphyrin — helps organize molecular oxygen and carbon-dioxide transport and provides the necessary electron-transport chains essential for cellular respiration. Because of their commanding role in life processes, porphyrin abnormalities are responsible for a range of serious diseases.Porphyrins can also be used as catalysts in synthetic devices known as electrochemical cells, which convert chemical energy into electrical energy, or vice versa. Although radiant energy from the sun may be stored within conventional types of batteries, such applications are limited by their low-energy densities compared with fuels used for modern transportation.Moore’s efforts to design artificial photosynthetic systems could provide a valuable piece of the renewable energy puzzle, producing “non-fossil-based” fuels as well as a range of beneficial commodities.Such devices would allow the capture and storage of solar energy for use when and where it is needed and can be constructed using chemicals that are far cheaper and more abundant than the materials currently in use for conventional solar energy applications.The paper has been selected for the cover of the current issue of the journal, with a descriptive graphic produced by Jason Drees, multimedia developer lead at ASU, and is part of a special collection dedicated to Professor Jean-Michel Savéant.]]>",post_date:"09/03/2021-11:30am",clas_teaser:"In new research appearing on the cover of the journal ChemElectroChem, Moore and his colleagues describe the use of ring-shaped molecules known as porphyrins.

His experience working for tribes and the government, as well as his success in developing effective partnerships make him a perfect fit for our ILP team.”Beetso said he is honored to return to ASU Law as faculty.“The great work the ILP has done since its inception at ASU Law has furthered the life goals of so many talented Native and non-Native professionals and has helped ensure tribal nations receive excellent representation in the legal field,” he said. “I am humbled to be able to share my experience, and I look forward to contributing to the ILP’s mission as best I can.”The first of their kind in the nation, the Indian gaming and tribal self-governance programs were established thanks to an initial contribution generously given by the San Manuel Band of Mission Indians to further ASU Law’s commitment to serving the educational needs of tribal nations. With the Indian gaming emphasis, ASU Law is providing in-depth courses for students on the regulation, compliance and implementation of Indian gaming. ASU Law’s Master of Legal Studies (MLS) degree will equip professionals with the essential legal components of Indian gaming to excel in careers that intersect with Indian gaming.Similarly, the self-governance emphasis is designed to educate students, whether they desire to work for tribes, the federal government or states, in really understanding the legal framework of the tribal-federal relationship, the federal programs and statutes that promote tribal self-governance and the implementation of that legal framework.The support from the San Manuel Band of Mission Indians will help increase educational opportunities in the field of Indian law and the expansion of work experiences for students interested in Indian law, and it will continue to contribute to the development of Indian law trainings for Indian tribes and organizations.

For example, the proposed framework directs $65 billion to foster greater use of renewable energy sources within America’s power grid, but it doesn’t exactly define how that will happen.“Wind is certainly well-positioned for expansion,” said Ronald Calhoun, an associate professor of civil and environmental engineering in the Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering at Arizona State University. “The technology is mature and reliable. Plus, it’s highly cost effective. Actually, wind is market competitive even without financial incentives. So, there are good reasons for its further development.”According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, renewable energy sources now represent 20% of the electricity generated in America. Within that sector, wind is the most significant source (8.4%), followed by hydropower (7.3%) and solar (2.3%). Additionally, wind energy continues to grow more substantially than any other renewable. Its share of that category is expected to exceed 10% this year as new facilities enter operation.“When we talk about new wind energy sites, the Great Plains are considered the richest resource area in the United States,” said Calhoun, who is director of the Environmental Remote Sensing Group, which operates within the School for Engineering of Matter, Transport and Energy, one of the seven Fulton Schools. His team conducts atmospheric research and technology development to advance wind energy industry systems.“The region is ideal in that it has excellent wind and also is not very populated,” he said. “But whatever you build in those remote spaces needs to be connected to the grid. And that route to market is a big issue.”High-voltage lines cross cities, counties and states, and there is no single federal authority to secure the necessary permissions to build new ones. Additionally, they cost a lot of money. To address these hurdles, the infrastructure framework now before Congress includes establishment of a new Grid Development Authority to finance and facilitate new transmission lines.Laying this literal groundwork is crucial to building new wind energy sites. But it’s also important for expanding the number of commercial solar energy facilities, since solar farms operate in similarly isolated regions. For example, the Agua Caliente Solar Project outside Yuma, Arizona, and the Solana Generating Station near Gila Bend, Arizona, cover more than 4,000 acres in the open desert.“Investing in the physical grid is probably one of the most important things we can do to support burgeoning renewable energy fields such as wind and solar,” Calhoun said. “The other challenge is figuring out the intermittency issue. How do we tackle the times when the wind doesn’t blow and the sun doesn’t shine?”Gigawatts through a pipeMuch attention has turned to advancing battery technology as a means to balance out the fluctuating nature of power generated by wind and solar sites. But many experts say batteries are too expensive to encourage more commercial-scale renewable energy generation.“Batteries are great for short cycles of loading and unloading. They can work for storing grid energy from morning to evening. But their capital cost is too large to sit on electricity for six months,” says Klaus Lackner, a professor of environmental engineering in the School of Sustainable Engineering and the Built Environment, also one of the Fulton Schools at ASU.By contrast, Lackner says the cost of storing and moving energy in liquid form is negligible. Think of all the energy on tap at gas stations across the country. Also consider that a single gallon of gasoline represents the daily kilowatt usage of a typical American household.“The power we can run through pipelines dwarfs what we can get through transmission lines,” Lackner said. “We can move gigawatts through a single pipe.”But how do we practically transform energy generated by wind and solar farms into liquid fuel? The answer could be the technology of capturing carbon from the air.Lackner is director of the Center for Negative Carbon Emissions, which researches technology to capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to both combat the adverse effects of climate change and help advance sustainable energy infrastructure.Central to their work is the development of a “mechanical tree” system that harvests CO2 from the air. While still at prototype stage, application of the new technology includes concentrating the carbon dioxide for commercial use in carbonating beverages, filling fire extinguishers and making dry ice.“We also can combine that CO2 with hydrogen produced through the electrolysis of water using renewable energy like solar. And through that combination, we can create gasoline or diesel or jet fuel,” Lackner said. “The necessary technology already exists, but it needs to get cheaper through a little more innovation and expanding scale. My prediction is that it will happen in the next five years.”Fuel literally created from the air could offer the storage medium needed to solve the intermittency issue impeding greater adoption of wind and solar energy generation technology. It could also attenuate fossil fuel extraction and processing for transportation. If carbon from the atmosphere can power our planes, trains and automobiles, there may be no need to drill into the earth for more petroleum.This innovation seems like a pivotal opportunity to arrest the greenhouse gas accumulation driving climate change; and carbon capture is explicitly listed as a new technology priority in the infrastructure framework before Congress.But Lackner and colleagues at the Fulton Schools point out that averting greater ecological adversity requires more than recycling atmospheric carbon. Additional volumes need to be prevented entirely, and that likely means electrifying transportation.Gorilla in the roomAccording to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, a quarter of all greenhouse gas emissions in America come from electricity generation. But transportation accounts for an even larger share of the problem: 29%.To reduce those gases, the bipartisan bill in Congress also dedicates nearly $6 billion to replace aging public transit system buses with zero-emission vehicles. Additionally, $7.5 billion is earmarked to start a national network of vehicle-charging stations to accelerate the adoption of electric cars.“It’s a logical step if we really want to cut emissions,” said Vijay Vittal, a Regents Professor of electrical engineering in the School of Electrical, Computer and Energy Engineering, also one of the Fulton Schools. “But if everybody buys an electric car, the added loads on our distribution grid suddenly become very large. How are we going to support those additions? This question is sort of an 800-pound gorilla in the room.”Vittal explains that the padmount transformers used in most residential neighborhoods are typically designed to supply four or five households. There are millions of these units across the country, but they were designed and deployed at a time when demand for energy was lower. So, if droves of people start driving electric vehicles, our current power distribution systems won’t be able to handle charging them all after work each day.Consequently, there is an acute need for urban and suburban grid modernization to support consumers and commerce; and it parallels the need for added high-voltage transmission infrastructure to support wind and solar farms in remote corners of America. Both are long-overdue investments in the capacity and resilience of a system that is vital to the operation of society.“Fortunately, this is not a technology issue,” said Vittal, who is a former director of the National Science Foundation’s Power Systems Engineering Research Center, a consortium of universities and industry focused on the future of electrical energy infrastructure. “At a local level, our utilities just need to pull out those old transformers put in new ones. Of course, there is significant cost to work at this scale. But the cost of not doing it may be even greater.”Top photo: Renewable energy generation technologies are capable of supplying a greater share of national power demand. But making that happen requires investment in fundamental transmission and distribution elements of the electricity grid.

He speaks seven languages, has been a visiting professor in 10 different countries and has a strong research collaboration network across six continents. He has a deep and diverse cultural appreciation that allows him to understand and collaborate with people all around the world.Scornavacca joins ASU from the University of Baltimore, where he was the Parsons Professor of Digital Innovation and director of the Center for Digital Communication, Commerce and Culture. His research focuses on the intersection of disruptive digital innovation with socioeconomic and environmental impact."I look at the development of digital innovation and how it can produce a smart, equitable and sustainable future," Scornavacca said. "How can we use digital technologies to help reduce our carbon footprint or create more inclusive financial systems? How can we leverage the capabilities of the digital ecosystem to foster entrepreneurship that creates positive socio-economic and environmental outcomes?"Scornavacca believes that while digital innovations are disruptive and pose risks, it also has immense potential to do some good."Technological development and technological innovation need to be looked at with a balance between the positive and negative impacts and always in light of the context that is being used," Scornavacca said. "How can technology, instead of furthering inequalities, actually help to create a better world for everyone?"Beza MeridAssistant professor in the School for the Future of Innovation in Society in the College of Global FuturesWhen discussing illness and disease, stand-up comedy isn't the traditional venue. But the contradiction between comedy and tragedy can actually lead to some intimate conversations. The unlikely pair has become one of the topics of Beza Merid's research. He studies people's experiences of illness and disease, and the types of social and cultural elements that can shape those experiences. He has found that stand-up comedy can enable people to have more difficult and often taboo conversations, and even creates a shared experience."Stand-up comedy operates as a place where people have conversations that bend the rules of society," Merid said. "It enables us to explore and confront these difficult topics and not think of them as isolated, personalized experiences that we have to deal with on our own. Stand-up comedy can create a collective understanding that shows we're all struggling with these kinds of things. It's something we can all relate to."Merid joins ASU from the University of Michigan Medical School, where he also studied the technologies and innovation surrounding health and illness. Part of his research looked at whether mobile apps could be used to encourage people with high blood pressure to eat healthier and exercise more. But not everyone has access to the same resources to make the technology most effective. The technology only works if everyone has access to the same resources."We can design technologies, but we can't really innovate our way out of these structural problems," Merid said. "One of the important things for us to do when we're thinking about the relationship between health and technology innovation is to think about the broader political and social systems that create these problems to begin with. By bringing all those things together, we have a better shot of collectivizing our solutions."Janna Goebel Assistant professor in the School of Sustainability in the College of Global FuturesJanna Goebel is no stranger to ASU. She recently completed her PhD in educational policy and evaluation at the Mary Lou Fulton Teachers College. But her focus on sustainability is relatively new. While earning her PhD, she learned more about the sustainability work happening at ASU and started engaging with the researchers behind it. That urge to study sustainability and our interconnectedness with nature took her to Brazil for her dissertation. She studied how education can be conceptualized beyond the current approach that puts humans at the center of everything."I'm interested in how we can reconfigure our relationships with the Earth," Goebel said. "I study how education can influence and change our perceptions so that we can see beyond our view of human exceptionalism."Sustainability education is more than just incorporating Sustainable Development Goals into the curriculum. Goebel's research also looks at environmental justice and how education is part of the problem and solution to the sustainability challenges we're facing."The power dynamics of the world create sustainability problems," Goebel said. "We know that the people who suffer most from climate change do not contribute most to its causes. We have to look at how education is part of that system of oppression, but also liberation. We have to see how sustainability education can be incorporated across all different discipline areas so that we can start to chip away at some of these very persistent status quo power dynamics that are causing some to suffer much more than others."Ding FeiClinical assistant professor in the School of Sustainability in the College of Global FuturesA conversation with road builders in western China helped shape Ding Fei's research. While doing international fieldwork for her master's degree in geography, she spoke with a team of workers and learned they were headed to East Africa for their next project. She wanted to learn more about China's global presence and why these construction workers would travel to another country to work, so she followed them to East Africa to observe their operations."There is a big debate about China," Fei said. "Some people say China is a distinctive development partner; they have good foreign policies, are very generous in providing loans and investment, and will contribute to sustainable development in Africa. But others say China is a neocolonial power and is using elite diplomacy or resource diplomacy to perpetuate African underdevelopment."While conducting her research in East Africa, Fei felt that China did not give a very clear picture of what it was doing overseas or how its activities influenced development in other countries. She wants to bring a more critical analysis of China's overseas activities to better understand the nation's impact and the implications of sustainable development in the Global South."When we talk about China or any emerging power, we often use very nationalistic terms to address it as a whole, coherent actor while operating abroad," Fei said. "But in fact, there are so many institutions and actors from China, and they have different layers of interactions with the African host country. When they interact, many contingencies or complexities emerge. Also, the host country is not just a passive recipient of aid or investment. It is also trying to carve its developmental path, but its ability to do so is often limited by its own history, domestic political conditions, social conditions and government capabilities. We need to both recognize the agency or the strategies of the host countries, but also critically analyze their constraints to inform policymaking in the future."Danae Hernandez-Cortes Assistant professor in the School for the Future of Innovation in Society and the School of Sustainability, both in the College of Global FuturesDanae Hernandez-Cortes wanted to help vulnerable communities and felt one way to do that was through the lens of economics. But when she arrived in Mexico City to earn her bachelor's degree in economics, she noticed another problem that needed solving: pollution. And she believed that environmental policies were one of the contributors."When I was starting my undergrad, I wanted to understand what parts of environmental policy were affecting pollution and how we can solve them," Hernandez-Cortes said. "I then decided to do my PhD in economics to try to get more knowledge on how these different policies could affect pollution exposure."Hernandez-Cortes' research took an interdisciplinary approach with an emphasis on equity; she focused on the sources of environmental inequality and the distributional consequences of environmental policy. She found that her background in economics was instrumental in her research."Economics is all about scarcity and trade-offs," Hernandez-Cortes said. "Recognizing that scarcity, and that the policy implications we are trying to achieve have trade-offs, is the main basis for environmental policy. There's nothing more scarce than natural resources, and trying to solve different environmental problems will always involve trade-offs. By looking at these, we're able to understand better policies that could help design efficient and equitable environmental policy."]]>`,post_date:"09/02/2021-8:47pm",clas_teaser:"This semester, five new faculty members are joining the College of Global Futures.

Whether students keep the same one throughout their time in college, change them along the way or double them up, majors play a central role in the college experience.Rarer, though, are mentions of a minor or an academic certificate gained through completing specially arranged courses. That’s often because students don’t have a minor or in many cases may not even know they exist.Faculty members in Arizona State University's Watts College of Public Service and Community Solutions say minors deepen students’ academic experiences and offer complementary knowledge to what they are getting from their majors that can make a difference as they enter careers — and adding a minor often costs no additional tuition.The college offers 13 minors, nine of which are within the School of Community Resources and Development. Those nine minors range from special event management to recreation therapy to community sports management.Watts College enrollment estimates for this semester report that about 604 ASU students have minors based at the college out of more than 9,800 throughout the university.In addition, the School of Criminology and Criminal Justice offers a minor in criminology and criminal justice, the School of Social Work offers one in social welfare, and the School of Public Affairs offers one each in public service and public policy, and in urban and metropolitan studies.The college also offers 14 certificate programs for completing certain menus of courses. Find them, as well as the college’s minors, on this list of all ASU academic minors and certificates.Minors can refine broader themes in majorsMinors and certificate programs offer students ways to enhance learning from courses in their majors, say two School of Community Resources and Development faculty members, who work with several students with minors.A student’s experience in a more broadly defined major can benefit from a minor, said Lecturer Claire McWilliams, who teaches tourism development management.“I see minors as smart extensions that broaden the reach of a bachelor’s degree,” McWilliams said. “You could have a dozen students graduate with a communications degree, but only a few of them will have an events certificate and a minor in tourism.”Including minors and certificates on a resume can make students stand out to potential employers, McWilliams said. “I see them as a very practical thing.”Erin Schneiderman, a clinical assistant professor who teaches special events management, agreed based on evidence she has observed among students who take that subject as a minor.“When they take it as a minor, it means they want to go deeper into the events industry. They believe that the additional credential will enhance their major,” Schneiderman said. “For example, a (criminology and criminal justice) major will say, ‘I’m interested in special events management, and if I’m working in law enforcement and assigned to a specific event, I’ll want to know what’s happening around me.’”Schneiderman said other examples include fashion majors learning about how fashion shows are created, or art students who know they will show their work in public art festivals, both of which are discussed in special events management classes.Some students don’t know minors are availableThe often-large undertaking of choosing a major sometimes leaves some students forgetting or even unaware they can pick a minor or certificate program as well, McWilliams said.“There’s a big challenge for them to sort out majors. We’re trying to get them to be aware of minors and certificates in the larger picture in putting together their college program,” McWilliams said.A more diverse menu of items on a student’s academic transcript show that student has had a more well-rounded experience, McWilliams said.In addition to complementing a student’s major, a minor also can afford the chance to explore a second discipline that interests them, said Joanna Lucio, Watts College associate dean for academic affairs.“For instance, minoring in a language, such as Spanish, can help a nonprofit major who wants to work for a nonprofit that serves a Spanish-speaking population,” Lucio said. “Or, a criminal justice or public service and public policy major might minor in social welfare if they want to focus their careers in social services.”Students gain additional knowledge that will help them on a career path, broaden their perspective and add depth in an area of their interest — and it is reflected on their academic transcript, she said.Students praise adding minors to their experienceAlexandra Monksfield, a junior supply chain management and business (public policy) major, said she uses knowledge from her special events management minor every day.“Events management is very similar to project management,” Monksfield said. “I use the key ideas and tools I have learned to put them in a business aspect and give me the upper hand to finding more creative ways to solve issues. Not only does my minor allow me to interact with people not in the business program, but I am also given more opportunities across the job market.”Samantha Sahagun, a junior social work major, recently added a minor in parks and protected area management that she said will provide her more resources for day-to-day living.“I have always been very passionate and fascinated with being outdoors and wanting to better the environment. I thought the perfect way to accomplish this was by furthering my knowledge by adding a minor in something that I am passionate about and can hopefully use in my social work career,” Sahagun said.Caitlin Personale, a senior marketing major, said her special events management minor has opened up several new doors, introducing her to “countless people, companies and roles never before thought of.”“I was able to identify key strengths of mine and strong passions within the classes that I was previously unaware of,” Personale said. “From nonprofit leadership to sports tourism, both the transferable skills and real-world application value are unbeatable.” Lucio said that while students can have more than one minor, she strongly recommends students consult with their academic advisers before enrolling. Interested students can find information about minors and certificate programs from this list.  ]]>",post_date:"09/02/2021-4:11pm",clas_teaser:"Faculty members in ASU’s Watts College of Public Service and Community Solutions say minors deepen students’ academic experiences and offer complementary knowledge to what they are getting from their majors that can make a difference as they enter careers — and adding a minor often costs no additional tuition.",teaser:"",story_images:"",hero_image:"https://news.asu.edu/sites/default/files/styles/asu_news_article_hero/public/140404-graduation-cap-and-pitchfork-silhouette3.jpg?itok=AYC8I1Is",path:"https://news.asu.edu/20210902-adding-minor-can-enhance-what-student-learns-major",hide_byline:"0","contributor-contact-information-affiliation":"Watts College of Public Service and Community Solutions","contributor-contact-information-name":"Mark J.

Here's what she learned.This year may well be one of southern Arizona’s wettest monsoons in recorded history, and that has translated into vibrant plant growth and an increase in insect and animal populations after years of extreme drought.The photo above shows a large pond in the grasslands near the U.S.-Mexico border, east of Nogales, Arizona, and is exactly what researchers from BioKIC, or the Biodiversity Knowledge Integration Center, wanted to see. The researchers planned out a monsoon collection trip this past weekend, and while it's open to researchers, students and their families, they were kind enough to invite me with them as well. As an Arizona native it felt like a rare chance to go onto our public lands and learn about the plants, insects and animals of southern Arizona.When I first arrived at the Coronado National Forest campsite on Friday night, white sheets were being set up, glowing brightly in the darkness. These white sheets are clamped to a metal frame with a mercury vapor light at top, and a black light resting in the middle of the sheet. The lights were connected to a generator and run until midnight, attracting all types of insects from the dark. Between dinner and breaks, chatting folks examined the sheets to see what had been attracted, commenting at the variety and beauty of the insects. Researchers opted between cupping the small insects in their hands and placing them in vials or jars, or using the aspirator, a kind of vaccuum that pulls in small insects with a filter protecting the operators. These methods work well, but what struck me as interesting was that experts don't know why insects are attracted to the lights. They have theories, but no one knows why they're drawn to bright lights.The students, researchers and community members all spend time together, creating a strong sense of community interest. I'm perfectly welcome to ask a series of silly questions to experts in their field about how many insect species exist in the world or why they collect this beetle but not that one. Or why are moths dusty? And thankfully there are no unwelcome questions.I ask, "Why this particular area of the Patagonia mountains?""This kind of highlands region, and to the Santa Rita mountains north of us, really contained a lot of interesting records from jaguars to a lot of reptiles and amphibians that just get into the U.S. from Mexico and extend their range into here," said Andrew Johnston, invertebrates collections manager and darkling beetle researcher. "So there were a lot of potentially interesting things for us to find in the less documented mountain range."As the night continues, we find the Arizona state reptile, an Arizona ridge-nosed rattlesnake, curled at the base of a tree just a few feet from one campsite. We walk the small creek looking for frogs and toads, which you can hear but not really see. One camper shares the cicada they found preparing to molt, while botanist Elizabeth Makings shares a desert stink beetle and a dragonfly rests on the white sheet.I also learned that although experts are very familiar with all the mammal species on Earth, there's a huge question mark on insect species. "It’s likely that we’ve not described even half of the diversity of insects that currently exist and alive in the world today," Johnston said.A lack of knowledge of the insect life in an area adds to a lack of future understanding about our environment and ecological systems, as climate change affects our state over time. The generators go out at midnight and folks head to tents for the evening. As the sun rises over the mountains, green stretches all across the mountains and grasslands below, a shocking green that almost seems out of place in Arizona nowadays.In the morning, Makings and researcher Ed Gilbert head up a stream that runs through the campsite with three ASU undergraduate students — Ethan Wright, Marcus Reid and Mary Haddad. Makings spends time walking with the students as they explore the grasses, plants, insects and the environment."I love to do fieldwork; I mean, why wouldn't you get buggy and hot and sweaty," said Makings, who helps organize the trips. "It's all about the camaraderie and, you know, interacting with scientists that are ... amazing in their field, and I just enjoy learning from everybody."Gilbert's son, Aven Klecker, manages to catch a fencepost lizard with his lizard lasso. While holding the lizard in his hand, he flips it upside down and gently rubs its belly, which puts it into a still state. He shows the trick to Haddad, who holds the lizard until he jumps up and runs aways.As we concluded our walk, another set of researchers jumped in four-wheel-drive vehicles to explore the mountaintop areas reachable only by some rough forest roads. As we drive through some of the most scenic areas, we look for areas of interest and finally stop at a high point with a depression that has filled with water, creating a kind of pond in the center.Researchers head out into the water with their nets to catch dragonflies or photograph botanical species. With every interesting find, everyone rushes over to take a look before the insects are released. School of Sustainability researcher Rick Overson spends time photographing the different insects with his 100mm macro lens, and environmental and zoological collections manager Laura Steger uses her net to collect dragonflies before we finally head back to camp. After a quick lunch, another group of researchers heads down to the nearly chest-height grassland areas near the U.S.-Mexico border. Just near Lochiel, Arizona, we pull off on a road and head to a grassy area, after being rained out of the road to Scotia Canyon in the Huachuca Mountains. We can see the monsoon storm clouds all around but somehow don't receive a hint of rain. The grasses give way to a small pond where we find a frog and a western patch-nosed snake, which apparently is a county over from where it is described as having range; this is noted. We patch a punctured tire and someone passes around Trader Joe's cookies as we decide to head up to reach the campsite before dark. Folks are trying to bet whether the rains hit our campsite and if their sleeping bags will be soaked. We reach the camp to find that it has not only rained but hailed, and while those who stayed behind tried their best to protect the area, everything is wet and damp. Unfortunately this means most insects won't come out to the white sheet at all, so we sit down and eat a spaghetti dinner together. Folks share photos from the day's finds. We hear jokes and stories about past trips and almost impassible roads, along with a limerick or two before everyone heads to bed.The next morning everyone sits down for breakfast and a final touch-base as the camp breaks down. I interview Johnston and Makings and record sound of the stream, which is running with water this morning, and plan out my route back home through Patagonia to Tucson and back to Phoenix. Makings is leaving with over 150 grass specimens — a wealth of samples after years of drought, which may take weeks to process back at the Alameda Center.Johnston shows me the tools of the trade, including forceps, an aspirator, nets and archival vials — though takeout containers can work temporarily as well. He says sometimes he saves samples in his freezer until he's ready to process, and it makes me wonder if that ever surprises anyone. It's a bright beautiful morning as we all head back to regular life, and I'm glad I spent this weekend out in the wilderness with such an amazing group of experts. ]]>`,post_date:"09/02/2021-4:05pm",clas_teaser:"Arizona State University photographer and videographer Deanna Dent joined researchers from the Biodiversity Knowledge Integration Center on a trip to southern Arizona where they collected insects after a strong monsoon.

P. Carey School of Business at ASU.“Could we apply bot-detection technology and augment that by relying on human intelligence in the crowd responses?”Benjamin's most recent paper on detecting malicious bots was published in PeerJ Computer Science, an open-access journal. He worked with Raghu Santanam, who holds the McCord Chair of Business in the Information Systems Department, and that research looked at how how the same fake news translated across various regional dialects may be detected using advanced linguistic models.Bots are dangerous because they spread misinformation and conspiracy theories."This vaccine misinformation is scary stuff," he said, so finding a faster and better way of detecting bots is more important. That's why Benjamin decided to look at whether adding humans to the computer algorithms was more accurate.He used the platform Reddit because it has posts and replies that lend themselves to looking at crowd reactions. The researchers wanted to weigh the level of certainty over people’s bot detection.“You could have two users and one might say, ‘I think this is a bot’ and the other might say, ‘I know for sure this is a bot.’“That’s the angle of our research — how to signal different certainties. You don’t want to blindly trust every crowd response.”One factor that can hamper research is the lack of public data sets from social media platforms. Reddit is maintained by volunteer moderators who share lists among themselves of which accounts might be bots. The researchers collected those lists, then analyzed the crowd responses to posts from those accounts.They applied “speech action theory,” a linguistic theory, to determine the level of certainty that someone found a bot.“It’s a way to quantify the intended or underlying meaning of spoken utterances,” Benjamin said.In the replies, the researchers looked at whether “bot” was mentioned, which was a strong indicator of accuracy in finding a bot. Sentiment, such as a strong negative reaction to the topic of bots, was a less important indicator.The research, which is currently under review, found that analyzing the human reactions added to the accuracy of the computational bot-detection system.It’s important to root out bots because they are a major source of misinformation spread on social media. Bots controlled by Russian trolls are a major driver of the lies that the 2020 election was stolen, researchers say. Last spring, Benjamin authored an op-ed column in the Boston Globe about how social media platforms need to step up the fight against misinformation.“(Bots) hijack conversations on controversial issues to derail or inflame the discussion,” he wrote. “For example, bots have posed as Black Lives Matter activists and shared divisive posts designed to stoke racial tensions. When real people try to make their voices heard online, they do so within a landscape that’s increasingly poisoned and polarized by bots.”Never before in human history have foreign governments been so successful in being able to target the populace of another country. — ASU Assistant Professor Victor BenjaminOne way social media platforms can help curb bots is by releasing more data to their users, who could then decide whether a post is from a bot.“We’re relying on public, open-source data — whatever the platforms make available to us. But the platforms have a lot of data they never reveal, such as how often users log in or how many hours their activity level remains continuous. A bot might have a 16-hour session,” he said.“If you see someone posting very inflammatory messages, why can’t the platform reveal that data? ‘This user posts 300 messages a day, and they’re all inflammatory about America.’“Or if there’s a hashtag that suddenly becomes popular on Twitter, Twitter has the metadata to show how that hashtag was formed. Was it organic growth or did it appear millions of times out of nowhere within a few minutes?”No private data would need to be revealed.“We just need metadata on usage of a hashtag or origin of country of where a hashtag is most frequently tweeted from.“If it’s a Black Lives Matter tagline being tweeted from Russia, we should be suspicious.”The problem is that it’s not in the social media platforms’ best interest to do anything that would decrease engagement, he said.“The more a user engages, whether it’s a bot or not, the more it helps the value of the platform.“If they say, ‘30 percent of users are bots,’ what does that do to the value of the platform?”Scrutiny of social media platforms heightened during the divisive 2016 election.“With Facebook, I’ll give them credit. They released data saying, ‘We noticed a lot of advertising paid for by Russian state agencies,’ ” Benjamin said.“And Twitter put out a small grant for improving the conversational health of social media. They acknowledged some of their responsibility for maintaining the quality of online conversations, but they’re still not at the level we want them to be of releasing the metadata.”Benjamin called the current state of affairs “an arms race” between bot authors and bot detection.“Social media bots out in the wild today are always listening for new instructions from their owners. They can change their behavior in real time.“If you have a static detection method, invariably the bots will learn to evade it.”That’s why a system incorporating humans could be faster and more accurate. But the system would have to be adaptable, learning linguistic patterns from different languages.The next frontier for bots — and using human detection — will be video.“If you go on YouTube, there are now algorithmically generated videos that are completely generated by bots. It’s a lot of the same stuff — to spread misinformation and random conspiracies and so on,” he said.The bots are creating narrative videos with unique content and music.“Some are of low quality, but you wouldn’t be able to tell whether they are bot-generated or by someone who is new to creating videos,” he said.One way to catch bot-generated videos is through applying the “theory of mind,” or the ability to consider how another person would see something — a perspective that is difficult for bot-generated content. For example, a human would align the visual and audio content in a video, but a bot might not.“Where would a human content creator apply theory of mind that a bot might not, and how can we see those discrepancies?” Benjamin asked.He said that vaccine misinformation amplified by bots is especially scary.“Never before in human history have foreign governments been so successful in being able to target the populace of another country,” he said.Top image courtesy of Pixabay.com]]>`,post_date:"09/02/2021-3:35pm",clas_teaser:"ASU Professor Victor Benjamin has been researching malevolent social media bots by using a human touch.

Now it’s a place where students study health and nursing, journalism, public service and law; gather in open spaces for social events; and do outreach with various local communities.The campus marks its 15th anniversary this school year.“The ASU Downtown Phoenix campus represents the best of what is possible when a city joins forces with an innovative university to address a community need and reimagine all the ways they can collaborate to be of service,” said ASU President Michael Crow. “ASU believes that universities should be accessible wherever there is an opportunity to help learners and the community at large to thrive, and we’re proud of the growth and experiences our downtown campus creates for learners and partners alike, as well as the robust, cross-sector network it has revitalized in the heart of our metro region.”Prior to the Downtown Phoenix campus, ASU had never tried to sell an urban experience. Its establishment came as result of an unprecedented referendum.Public money was involved. The basketball arena was downtown, but unless there was a game, the streets were empty in the evenings. Civic leaders knew the area needed more to push it to the next level. And that included populating the area with students who would live, work, study and shop there.In short, these students would become citizens of the city and able to pursue their careers in a more dynamic arrangement.New York City has Columbia. Los Angeles has UCLA. Phoenix needed an urban university. But there was no need to create one from scratch. What follows is the story of how a group of very determined people turned a napkin sketch into a viable 20-acre, multimillion-dollar university campus in a short amount of time that had skeptics wondering if it would ever really happen.Two decades ago, the streets of downtown Phoenix were populated by business people and the occasional event goer. Now students bring their energy and potential to ASU's campus, where a line of families moving students into the residence halls is a common sight each August. Photo by Charlie Leight/ASU NewsBreakfast of championsThe Downtown Phoenix campus wasn’t initially created on an architect’s draft table or an engineer’s rendering. It was sketched on a plain, white restaurant napkin.It started with two great minds — and two empty stomachs — over breakfast in 2003. Crow and then-Mayor Phil Gordon wanted more than a satellite school. They wanted bacon and eggs — and they wanted thousands to live and study in downtown Phoenix for a very long time.“Our first meeting took place at The Good Egg on Central and Camelback in Phoenix when I was running for Phoenix mayor,” said Gordon, who won the race in September 2003 and served as Phoenix’s mayor from 2004 to 2012. “Bringing ASU to the downtown area was one of things I pushed during my campaign. Dr. Crow said, ‘Great idea. Come back — win or lose — and let’s move this concept forward.'”They met again at the same restaurant shortly after Gordon’s victory, vowing to work together to take the university, the city and the region to new heights. Gordon, a municipal leader unafraid of taking on challenges, and Crow, the academic visionary who felt that the old college system was broken and who had declared ASU the “New American University,” seemed perfectly matched.Phoenix and the university’s burgeoning popularity added pressure to act swiftly to create an environment that would attract a “creative class” — people who would build a knowledge industry and develop technologies to nourish Arizona in the 21st century.Despite Phoenix’s designation as one of the nation’s largest cities, and its growth and prosperity in the new millennium, its core had been somewhat hollow, especially after business hours. Merging students, staff and faculty with merchants, artisans, government and nonprofits would inject a much needed, livelier ambiance in the city’s core.It would also help accommodate ASU’s booming numbers. In order to meet the projected growth in college-bound Arizona high school graduates, the university needed capacity. ASU began shifting its focus from Tempe to other campuses in the Valley to handle the overflow: ASU’s West and Polytechnic campuses, and a small satellite facility at the Mercado at Seventh and Van Buren streets. Both Crow and Gordon knew expanding ASU to a full-scale campus in downtown Phoenix made perfect sense.ASU Adjunct Professor Isaac Easley takes a headshot of Cronkite News Sports team member Mariah Graves, a graduate student in sports journalism, at the Cronkite News set on Aug. 19. The Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication was one of the first colleges that moved to the Downtown Phoenix campus 15 years ago. Photo by Deanna Dent/ASU NewsA blueprint for maroon and goldThat napkin became ASU’s blueprint — a campus geared toward city-minded students attracted to service-oriented careers. The area was teeming with government, media, nonprofit, legal, medical and business operations ripe for full- or part-time internships, mentoring and professional networking opportunities. The region’s bevy of professional arts, dance, theater and music venues; sports stadiums; and fine and casual dining would cap off the university’s unique work-study-live experience.A university design team, led by Wellington “Duke” Reiter, then dean of what was known as the College of Architecture and Environmental Design (now The Design School), said in early 2004 that he was pulled into Crow’s office and asked if he could design an urban campus for ASU. There weren’t yet too many hard-and-fast specifics, including which colleges would relocate downtown, but he was given one directive — have it done in 60 days.“How do you design a house before you know who the occupants are? How do you design a campus before you know which colleges will go there?” Reiter said. “The only thing I really knew was the scope, which was, one day the campus would potentially serve 15,000 students, which was a start.”Reiter also enlisted noted and locally based architecture firms to think beyond the normal constraints of what might be possible. The firms included Will Bruder Architects, Architekton, SmithGroup and DeBartolo Architects.They collectively identified several universities — George Washington University in Washington, D.C.; New York University; Emerson College in Boston; and Savannah College of Arts and Design in Georgia — as excellent models of how an urban campus interacts with the community.Reiter also advocated for a civic space or multiuse park to be used by the students and general public. The idea was to bridge the city and the university, and offer community-related events, sponsored by both entities. The end result was a $34 million sustainable space that opened in 2009 called Civic Space Park.A university design team also spent several months deciding which colleges should relocate to the downtown campus. They ultimately chose: the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication; Watts College of Public Service and Community Solutions; the Edson College of Nursing and Health Innovation; and University College.A few years later the campus added the Sandra Day O’Connor College of Law; College of Health Solutions; Thunderbird School of Global Management and the Graduate College. The College of Integrative Sciences and Arts; Mary Lou Fulton Teachers College; and Barrett, The Honors College also established a presence on the campus, as did a sprinkling of centers, think tanks and initiatives.Fusion on First, a combination high-rise residence hall and academic-entrepreneurship space, welcomed its first residents on Aug. 16.

The second and third floors will feature academic space with fashion being prominent on the second floor and music programing on third. Photo by Charlie Leight/ASU NewsNo Plan BWhen the city and ASU unveiled its master plan to the community, it was met with mixed praise from the business community, local residents and most especially the media. Landholders debated whether or not to sell their property; private developers in the area wondered if they should get involved; residents didn’t want the university to change the downtown’s character. Some media openly questioned the viability of the project.There were some members on the home team who wondered aloud if the city’s greatest revitalization project was really going to happen, given its collapsed timeline of getting the campus up and running by late August 2006.“One of the deans asked me early in the process what was ‘Plan B’?” said Mernoy Harrison, former ASU executive vice president and chief financial officer, who was selected by Crow to oversee the completion of the campus. “I told this person, ‘There is no Plan B. It’s do or die. We either launch this campus or die trying.”Harrison’s declaration soon became the battle cry for ASU and city of Phoenix employees, who designed, renovated and constructed a university campus in record-breaking time.But where to get the money?A 2006 Phoenix bond proposal would provide the necessary funds to build the campus. The proposal totaled $878.5 million for homeland security, education, parks, libraries, streets, fire stations and other city infrastructure and amenities. Of those funds, $223 million was earmarked for the ASU Downtown Phoenix campus — almost a fourth of the total and the largest single proposed bond expenditure.But it needed voter approval.That took place on March 14, 2006, winning over 60% of the vote according to the Associated Press. That was the good news. The bad — or at least stressful — news was that ASU and city officials had less than six months to renovate several buildings, purchase office supplies, equipment and furniture, strategize operations, move 600 faculty from the Tempe campus, and hire 80 new staff members, including the four founding deans. A tall order for a short window of time.School of Social Work graduate students Brandon Falk (left) and Ronald Bookman (right) chat with Westward Ho resident Douglas Meyer during an informal meetup in Civic Space Park in downtown Phoenix last winter. The social-hour activity was started by the ASU Community Collaborative as a way for residents to safely connect and is but one of many ways ASU students connect with the downtown community. Photo by Charlie Leight/ASU NewsThe planets alignConstruction crews scrambled, working around the clock while ASU burned the midnight oil planning for the massive four-college move — all while the new light rail system along Central Avenue was getting underway. Buildings were gutted and classrooms readied, while the torn-up streets made navigating a challenge.But then trucks and shipments with televisions, computers and furnishings started to arrive and, finally, it was done.“All the planets were aligned for this project,” Reiter said. “We had a mayor who was ready to do something great; a governor who was predisposed towards higher education; a university president who was ready to build; a community who supported this idea; a bond election, which could fund this and make it a reality; and a thriving economy, which gave voters the confidence to make positive change. It was the right cast of characters at the right economic time.”Several hundred dignitaries, employees, business owners and locals joined the Aug. 15, 2006, ribbon-cutting ceremony inside the University Center lobby to listen to special remarks from Gov. Janet Napolitano, Gordon and Crow, as well as take a tour of campus facilities. ASU’s Downtown Phoenix campus went from brainstorming sketch to reality in just three short years.And that fall, it welcomed more than 3,000 full-time and 6,000 part-time students. Today, that number has almost quadrupled to more than 11,000 full-time students. One of them is Noah Furtado, a Hawaiian native who came to Phoenix to study journalism.“I like that everything on the Downtown Phoenix campus is close by, and the longest walk I have to make for a class is about 15 minutes,” Furtado said. “There’s a really down-to-earth vibe here compared to Tempe. Everything is close by, and the people are close-knit.”Furtado also likes the amenities at the Cronkite School and hanging out with like-minded students.“I like the fact that the Cronkite building has a lot of editing bays, and you can go in there whenever you want to learn the craft and work with all of the different photo and video applications,” Furtado said. “It’s refreshing to be around a lot of people who are passionate about the same thing you are. It’s nice that we have a shared interest in sports journalism, and it’s something that I didn’t have with a lot of people back in Hawaii.”Also new to campus this year is Cronkite School Dean Battinto Batts Jr., who moved from Cincinnati this summer. He said living and working in downtown Phoenix has a vibrancy that he’s enjoying.“The downtown Phoenix campus has grown tremendously over the course of the past decade and has been a powerful catalyst in the community’s overall growth,” Batts said. “Being new to ASU, I am currently living downtown while looking for permanent housing. The energy is so appealing that we’re in no rush to leave. I am a believer in the role of higher education as transformers of communities. That role involves being a developer of buildings while also developing a vibe and a feel. Arizona State has accomplished both with its Downtown Phoenix campus, and I am excited to be a part of it.”Construction is in the final stages of the new home of the Thunderbird School of Global Management on the Downtown Phoenix campus, shown here Aug. 19. Photo by Deanna Dent/ASU NewsRoom to growThough it may seem to many that the campus has reached full maturation, it is in fact growing and still has room for expansion.This semester saw the opening of Fusion on First, a high-rise residential community at 380 N. First Ave. The building will include 13 floors of apartment-style student housing and several floors of classroom space, housing the fashion and popular music majors from the Herberger Institute for Design and the Arts.Another building nearing completion is the new home of the Thunderbird School of Global Management, which announced its relocation to the Downtown Phoenix campus in 2017. Thunderbird’s move from its former westside location to downtown Phoenix provides the opportunity to evaluate the curriculum and give them proximity to other ASU schools and colleges, while continuing to provide world-class global management and business education with a unique intercultural focus.Thunderbird’s new building is between First and Second streets, just north of Polk Street. It includes space for classrooms, meetings, enclave and office space and will include two levels for executive education. There will also be rooftop function space.Ongoing plans for the campus include continued growth of the existing academic programs currently on the campus, which, over time, means the need for more classroom, office and residential space. In addition, downtown has become a major center for health and bioscience research, with the opening this year of the Wexford Innovation Center on the Phoenix Biomedical Campus, which was another collaboration between the city of Phoenix and ASU, with the help of Wexford Science + Technology.TGen and private companies — along with all three state universities — are doing cutting-edge research to advance human health in the downtown area. ASU’s College of Health Solutions and Edson College of Nursing and Health Innovation are driving this research growth for ASU, and it is expected that additional university and private research activity will gravitate to and grow in the downtown area, along with the startups that emerge from this research.The Downtown Phoenix campus’ launch and continued success is one of Gordon’s proudest accomplishments in his eight years as Phoenix mayor.“It has succeeded way beyond anyone’s expectations,” said Gordon, who is now the director of the Chan Soon-Shiong Institute of Advanced Health, a data center dedicated to health information. “In addition to the campus, there’s the outgrowth of apartments, houses, restaurants, bars, grocery stores, retail businesses and commercial buildings. The campus has totally redeveloped downtown Phoenix, and now other major cities want college campuses in their downtowns, too."Top photo: Students make their way to classes at the Beus Center for Law and Society during the first day of fall 2021 classes on ASU's Downtown Phoenix campus Aug. 19.

For people who don’t have a network of family and friends to assist them after a hospitalization or surgery, the joy of going home can be tinged with anxiety.Bhatti had an idea that could help — a marketplace that connects nurses to patients and families who need medical guidance and support after a hospital stay or outpatient surgery. But with her intense schedule as a nurse caring for COVID-19 patients and as a PhD student at Arizona State University, coupled with a lack of business experience, Bhatti needed some help to get her company, Navi Concierge Nurses, off the ground.“My co-founder and I are nurses, so our expertise is in clinical care. It was a challenge for us to learn so many different other business-related skills like accounting, financing, marketing, creating strategic partnerships and more,” she said.Bhatti found the support she needed through the J. Orin Edson Entrepreneurship + Innovation Institute, officially established in 2020. Innovative problem solving, transdisciplinary research and inclusivity for all learners has always been at the heart of the ASU Charter, but a generous gift from J. Orin Edson set the stage for an evolution of the concept — in perpetuity.The gift was a major milestone in the Edson family’s long history of support to ASU.J. Orin Edson was, himself, the living embodiment of the entrepreneurial spirit. Deeply devoted to the community, he held the belief that talented and forward-thinking people like Bhatti should have the resources to pursue their entrepreneurial dreams. Edson and his wife, Charlene, have been ASU benefactors since 2005.“The Edsons helped set ASU on a path to valuing entrepreneurship with their initial gift in 2005 establishing the Edson Student Entrepreneur Initiative. That gift enabled ASU to be the first investors, as the ‘friends and family round,’ to student-driven startups and the development of new solutions,” said Ji Mi Choi, vice president for ASU’s Knowledge Enterprise and founding executive director of the Edson Entrepreneurship + Innovation Institute.The Edson Student Entrepreneur Initiative has paved the way for nearly 300 student-led ventures, which have filed more than 40 patents and raised more than $46 million in external funding. In 2018, a second endowed gift supported Edson Entrepreneurship + Innovation Institute training and development resources to accelerate innovation and entrepreneurship. It has also provided support for faculty to develop and offer extra- and co-curricular training utilizing a wide range of subject-matter expertise.Bhatti participated in the institute's Venture Devils and Venture Devils Plus programs, which currently include more than 700 teams. Since the start of the pandemic, both she and her co-founder have been focused on patient care in the hospital where they work. But in true entrepreneurial spirit, they have managed to grow their company in spite of trying circumstances. Bhatti said the institute's programs were influential in developing the clarity needed to design and actually create the business.“We were given the opportunity to connect with other professionals whose guidance helped us refine our strategies immensely,” said Bhatti, who is now completing her dissertation in the Edson College of Nursing and Health Innovation, named through a generous gift to ASU health care programs from the Edson family in 2019.  Bhatti admits that balancing school, work and business ownership was a challenge, especially when paired with the emotional, mental and physical fatigue of caring for COVID-19 patients.“I had to turn those painful emotions into fuel to propel this business forward,” she said. “It’s like you keep adding things to your plate and you have to figure it out as you go because everything becomes important. Right now for me, balance means just making sure I’m getting good sleep, I get to see my loved ones and I’m engaging in a handful of activities every day that bring me joy.”Edson Entrepreneurship + Innovation empowers students to concurrently pursue education and entrepreneurship. While the primary focus of the institute is ASU students, faculty, staff and alumni, it also supports a diverse range of lifelong learners and entrepreneurs of every age, interest and socioeconomic background. ASU’s entrepreneurship programs have received numerous awards over the years, including the Deshpande Symposium for Innovation and Entrepreneurship in Higher Education, and the Global Consortium of Entrepreneurship Centers Award for Outstanding Contribution to Venture Creation.The Edsons’ gracious contributions have allowed ASU to expand its portfolio of entrepreneurial programs and initiatives, as well as the depth and breadth of the programs.“ASU’s commitment and leadership in innovation is evidenced with the establishment of the institute and enables us to materially follow through on taking fundamental responsibility for the economic and community development and well-being of the communities we serve,” Choi said.“In addition to the stability of the institute serving as the foundation for entrepreneurial programming, we also galvanize support from many other philanthropic and funding sources to further the impact we have on advancing solutions — new products, new services and new processes — to address problems and unmet needs in society.”On top of collaborations with many ASU academic programs and colleges, Edson Entrepreneurship + Innovation facilitates multiple funding opportunities, provides collaborative working spaces for ventures at all stages, and offers training and development resources, including a robust mentor network to help up-and-coming entrepreneurs find solid footing.Bhatti credits her own mentor, Rick Hall, with believing in her and encouraging her to apply to the Venture Devils program. Hall is director of the Health Entrepreneurship Accelerator Lab (HEALab), and assistant dean and clinical professor of health innovation programs at the Edson College of Nursing and Health Innovation.“He connected us to a professor in the college of engineering who was able to help us create a prototype of our product,” Bhatti said. “He connected us with the law school so that I could save money by having students help with some of my initial legal documents. Dr. Hall also introduced me to a handful of incredible people throughout the university who have become followers of what we are building.”Through hard work, perseverance and leveraging the resources available to them, Bhatti and her co-founder were ready to make their business happen by the end of last year. They began taking their first clients in January 2021, went from zero to more than 90 nurses in their network, and have made almost $500,000 to date.What advice would Bhatti offer other student entrepreneurs?“It may sound kind of silly,” she said, “but I didn’t think that my idea was enough to really go and ask for help. In hindsight, I don’t want any student to ever think that. If anyone ever tells you that you have a good idea, roll with it. Believe in yourself as much as others believe in you. Especially in the beginning.“I promise that once you start to see what you are building is meaningful, you will understand the power of your idea. All it takes is the spark. The university has all the fuel to help the flames grow and spread.”Top photo: Jasmine Bhatti, founder of Navi Concierge Nurses and PhD student in the Edson College of Nursing and Health Innovation.

The 2022 version of the rankings, released today, draws on data on research published between 2016 and 2020, and citations made between 2016 and 2021.David Watkins, head of data science at Times Higher Education, said the citations effect was “to be expected given that COVID-19 has had such an impact worldwide.”“Research into the disease, and especially work on vaccines, was heavily funded and prioritized, and some papers have attracted more than 20,000 citations within a year of publication,” he said in the rankings’ official release.“Because (Times Higher Education) uses a five-year window for publications, we believe that this effect will remain noticeable in the rankings for some time, and it is likely that other COVID-related effects, such as reputational impact — both positive and negative — and income, will also become visible.”The rankings’ performance indicators are grouped into five pillars: teaching (the learning environment); research (volume, income and reputation); citations (research influence); international outlook (staff, students and research); and industry income (knowledge transfer). ASU’s top pillar is research (No. 129).Advancing research and discovery of public value is a key part of the charter of ASU, where there is an emphasis on research with real-world impact. Earlier this year, ASU moved up to sixth out of 759 universities in the nation for total research expenditures among universities without a medical school, according to the latest National Science Foundation Higher Education Research and Development (HERD) rankings. For fiscal year 2019, ASU had nearly $640 million in research expenditures.“Measuring research expenditures is a useful proxy for measuring what really matters: impact,” said Sally C. Morton, executive vice president of Knowledge Enterprise at ASU. “We measure our success not by grant dollars awarded, but by lives improved, because we believe deeply in a university’s moral imperative to bring radical advancement to the communities it serves — locally, nationally and globally.”]]>",post_date:"09/01/2021-6:05pm",clas_teaser:`Times Higher Education rankings released today place Arizona State University in the top 8% of worldwide universities, and among the top 50 in the United States.\r

Problem drinking is more common in college students than young adults who do not attend college, but the disparity in how alcohol use affects different people is not well understood in large part because there are few studies on minority populations. This work, which was published in Psychology of Addictive Behaviors in August, examined the pathways that lead to and protect against alcohol use problems in Black American college students.“Black American college students drink less than their peers but are more likely to have problems from drinking. Understanding what the risks and protective factors are for this group is important,” said Jinni Su, assistant professor of psychology at ASU and first author on the paper. “Racial discrimination was related to worse mental health outcomes, which increased the risk for alcohol use and related problems.”Discrimination is a known stressor that can lead to using alcohol as a coping mechanism. “When people experience stress and lack strong coping skills or resources, they can turn to alcohol or substance abuse as a coping mechanism. We know from previous research that people who experience racial and ethnic discrimination are more likely to have problems related to excessive drinking,” Su said.Racial discrimination was associated with alcohol use in two groups of Black American college students. The connection between the two was changes in mental health, in the form of increased depressive symptoms.“Racial discrimination increased the risk for alcohol use and related problems, and this relationship was linked to worse mental health outcomes,” Su said.The research team also examined whether how people think about their identity was protective against problem alcohol use. They assessed the impact of an individual having positive feelings about being a Black American and the belief that society at large has positive views about Black people.Participants who had positive feelings about being a Black American had a weaker link between discrimination, mental health and alcohol use. But, the association between racial discrimination, mental health and alcohol use was stronger for the participants who thought that society viewed Black people positively. “The impact of racial discrimination is not equal for everybody; it varies in part based on beliefs about identity,” Su said. “We found that participants who felt good about being Black were buffered from the effects of how discrimination might impact their mental health and drinking behavior. We also found that participants who think other people view them positively were more negatively impacted by discrimination, possibly because it is harder to understand unfair treatment.”Eleanor Seaton, professor in the T. Denny Sanford School of Social and Family Dynamics, also contributed to the work along with Chelsea Williams, the Spit for Science Working Group and Danielle Dick from Virginia Commonwealth University.This study was funded by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, the National Center for Research Resources, National Institutes of Health Roadmap for Medical Research, National Institute on Drug Abuse, the Center for Tobacco Products of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and Virginia Commonwealth University.]]>",post_date:"09/01/2021-1:45pm",clas_teaser:"A new study published in Psychology of Addictive Behaviors found racial discrimination led to depressive symptoms and to problem alcohol consumption in Black college students.

According to Emmett, this allows the society’s elected officials a reasonable time in office for accomplishment of their most important duty: planning and hosting conferences that provide a forum for established and young scholars to advance new ideas and research. Young scholars can apply for funding for the conference through the Warren and Sylvia Samuels Fund, a resource dedicated to the promotion of young academics. Emmett sees the History of Economics Society conferences as a great opportunity to “provide mentorship to young scholars … and have senior scholars comment on their scholarship.” As a young scholar, Emmett won best dissertation in 1992 for his work, “The Economist as Philosopher: Frank H. Knight and American Social Science During the Twenties and Thirties.”More than 300 international members of the History of Economics Society will be invited to meet in Vancouver, British Columbia, in January 2023 to discuss research materials and papers in the conference curated by Emmett and his team. Conference sessions and themes are organized around papers and research proposals submitted well in advance of the meeting; this approach allows for submissions from a broad range of thoughts and ideas, rather than responses to a prescriptive call. Per Emmett: “We want everyone to attend. We get Marxists and libertarians, conservatives and liberals, historians and philosophers.” Emmett, a self-described member of "the dismal science," corrected the author’s admiration for this egalitarian approach, insisting that pragmatism is the driving factor. He is an economist, after all.Since joining ASU in 2018, Emmett has taught three different history of economics-related courses and is regularizing a cross-listed history of economic thought course with the School of Civic and Economic Thought and Leadership and the W. P. Carey Department of Economics. As director of the Center for the Study of Economic Liberty, Emmett organized and held the Winter Institute for the History of Economic Thought in 2019 and 2020, and he is planning for the 2022 offering. Additionally, center researchers publish an annual report titled “Doing Business North America," a project that “annually provides objective measures of the scale and scope of business regulations in 130 cities across 92 states, provinces and federal districts of the U.S., Canada and Mexico. It uses these measures to score and rank cities in regard to how easy or difficult it is to set up, operate and shut down a business.”A fuller description of Emmett’s research and teaching can be found in his ASU profile. Most recently, Emmett has started a new research program, Economists on the Indigenous Peoples of North America, with the first foray into the subject being a paper titled “Frank Amasa Walker and the Indigenous Peoples of North America.” This will be presented at the January 2022 Allied Social Science Association meeting, which is the largest gathering of economists globally, with more than 13,000 attendees.]]>',post_date:"09/01/2021-1:42pm",clas_teaser:"ASU Professor Ross Emmett recently began his term as president of the History of Economics Society, an organization dedicated to “encouraging interest, fostering scholarship and promoting discussion among scholars and professionals in the field of history of economics and related disciplines.”",teaser:"",story_images:"",hero_image:"https://news.asu.edu/sites/default/files/styles/asu_news_article_hero/public/3283604.png?itok=Y_6kE_ni",path:"https://news.asu.edu/20210901-asu-professor-begins-term-president-history-economics-society",hide_byline:"0","contributor-contact-information-affiliation":"Center for the Study of Economic Liberty","contributor-contact-information-name":"Mason Hunt, MPA","contributor-contact-information-e-mail":"mchunt1@asu.edu","contributor-contact-information-campus":"Tempe campus",feed_image_link:"",image_url:"https://news.asu.edu/sites/default/files/styles/asu_news_article_hero/public/3283604.png?itok=Y_6kE_ni",image_alt:"portrait of ASU Professor Ross Emmett",image_caption:"",related_story:"",news_units:"School of Civic and Economic Thought and Leadership|The College of Liberal Arts and Sciences|Center for the Study of Economic Liberty|W.

Chávez Leadership Institute and the RISE Leadership Institute share resources and information that students need to be prepared for college financially, socially and academically. For the past two years, the format was adapted to a virtual environment, but in previous years, the events ranged from day camps to residential college experiences, which allow students to live on campus for a week. All participants get a taste of campus life while also receiving hands-on instruction in both academics and college readiness. Faculty, community and ASU student support helps make the camps enriching experiences that students don’t soon forget. Current ASU student Emilia Bañuelos, a speech and hearing sciences and family and human development major, was a 2016 César E. Chávez Leadership Institute participant. After her experience at the camp, she said she was inspired to serve as a facilitator.“When I saw that Access ASU was hiring summer mentors for various programs, including (César E. Chávez Leadership Institute), I applied within the hour because these programs not only create leaders but a supportive community,” Bañuelos said. She remembers her time at the César E. Chávez Leadership Institute fondly. What particularly stuck out was learning to avoid making assumptions, how first impressions matter and the power of a firm handshake. Bañuelos said that the camp helped her realize all the opportunities that ASU students have to make a difference in the community. “Attending these programs sets you in motion to be a high-achieving student, a leader in your community,” she said. Post-event surveys confirm that participants leave with tremendous knowledge and inspiration about what it takes to get to college and what fields they want to consider.  Surveys reveal it’s nearly unanimous that respondents feel prepared and confident in the steps they need to take to prepare for college, to pay for college and to prepare for the admissions process. Applications open in December for the 2022 programs. Camps are available at all four ASU campuses and involve a variety of hands-on coursework and training in leadership, engineering, critical thinking, electives, financial aid presentations and much more. Tours of the four unique campuses and tips about ASU resources, such as me3, an online tool that helps students connect their interests to future careers and fields of study, are also included.One Barrett Summer Scholars participant said that they were excited for the work and also the information about becoming a Sun Devil. “Barrett Summer Scholars was an amazing experience because I learned so much in my classes, and I also learned about ASU as a school. I would like to go to ASU someday, (and I enjoyed) seeing the campus through the virtual tours. I am so glad that I got to attend Barrett Summer Scholars, and I hope I get to next year,” they wrote. Access ASU’s summer camps serve many Arizona students, and recruitment includes special outreach to first-generation and underrepresented students. Scholarships are available for all camps and summer programs.The camps all offer scholarships.Summer Experience at West is a program at ASU’s West campus that was launched by Jose E. Náñez Sr., ASU President’s Professor of psychology, to help prepare students for college life, inspired by his own experience of having no role models as a Mexican American student. 
  Video of PSLA - Summer 2021 Wrap-Up

Video courtesy of Educational Outreach and Student ServicesChaparral High School junior Renee Hsu was a Summer Experience at West participant in 2021 who appreciated being surrounded by people who had similar interests and motivation.“I thoroughly enjoyed my professors, who have incredible experience and an amazing amount of knowledge that I am so grateful that they were willing to share with us,” she said. Some of the academic topics covered at Summer Experience at West included neuroscience, law, forensics and STEM.The Poly Summer Leadership Academy is usually held on ASU’s Polytechnic campus in Mesa, and the virtual event in 2021 included panel discussions led by ASU students and faculty, in addition to college-level academic content on attachment, psychotherapy, education and sustainability.  One survey respondent said that they especially appreciated the tips to get motivated and establish good habits. “I received so much information, resources and instruction about getting to college, picking my major, finding my niche in life, earning scholarships and helping me build a career path with a solid set of goals,” they said. “Poly Summer Leadership Academy truly was a major stepping stone to creating future leaders of all different types of backgrounds wherever they may go.”Marcelino Quiñonez, Access ASU director of community outreach and partnerships, said that this year’s camps showed the resilience and motivation of the next generation of college students.“The resources to get to college are out there, and the talent of Arizona students is something that always inspires us,” Quiñonez said. “ASU has so much to offer students to inspire and assist them in being college ready, and seeing these students’ persistence after the learning disruptions we’ve seen is simply amazing.”Something that is emphasized at each camp, aside from getting into college and exploring majors, is the idea of creating leaders and people who can improve their communities. As an alum of the César E. Chávez Leadership Institute, Bañuelos saw that idea come full circle in the students who led at the camp this year. “My biggest takeaway from being a summer program leader was seeing the programs transform students into student leaders. I thought it was amazing how in only a week, students who were shy were leading the conversation,” Bañuelos said. “These programs are an amazing opportunity to learn more about ASU and prepare you for greatness. When you do attend the wonderful Access ASU programs, do not be afraid to put yourself out there.”Registration for 2022 camps begins in December.

These invisible waves of electromagnetic radiation can also be used in a variety of imaging applications.From observing the Earth’s climate and surface topography to screening baggage at airports, microwaves can help us see things that may be hidden. That is because different frequencies of microwaves can penetrate objects that would normally block our vision in the visible light spectrum — such as clouds or the outer layer of a suitcase.However, the limitations of microwave imaging are the unfavorable size, weight, power consumption and cost of the systems. These factors limit their use to applications such as bulky scanners at airports or large satellites in orbit.Mohammadreza Imani, an assistant professor of electrical engineering in the Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering at Arizona State University, is looking to overcome these challenges by making microwave imaging systems more portable and accessible.His research focuses on one particular area of opportunity for microwave imaging: using metamaterials — engineered combinations of elements that have unique patterns or structures not found in nature — to simplify microwave imaging hardware and make it easier to generate images.Imani shares how to improve microwave imaging using metamaterials and how this new way of “seeing” can help inspect buildings, aid in search and rescue efforts, speed up airport security and even assist in our own home improvement projects.Mohammadreza Imani, an assistant professor of electrical engineering in the Ira A.

Photo by Deanna Dent/Arizona State UniversityQuestion: What is the big challenge with microwave imaging systems that you’re addressing?Answer: The complexity of current imaging systems comes from multiple factors. A crucial one is the antenna hardware.Think of a security screening system at an airport. This system has a mechanical arm equipped with many antennas that scan around the person. Though it can capture fantastic images, it is expensive, bulky and slow.Metamaterials offer a simple way to get several measurements of a particular scene of interest. In essence, they can alleviate the need for mechanical movement or using very large antenna arrays.Metamaterials consist of many inclusions, or encapsulated compounds in the material’s structure, that resonate when an electromagnetic wave interacts with them. Their resonance response determines the patterns generated.By designing metamaterial structures that exhibit specific resonance responses as a function of frequency or electronic signals, we can generate diverse patterns that interrogate the scene of interest and obtain several measurements of the scene.In this manner, we can replace multiple antennas with a single one that is fashioned with metamaterial structures. When we reduce the number of antennas and mechanical motion, we can make imaging systems faster and simpler.Q: How else do metamaterials address microwave imaging challenges?A: We can leverage metamaterials’ dynamic and diverse interactions with a scene to obtain enough measurements to form an image even at a single frequency. Other imaging systems use several frequencies over a wide bandwidth.Bandwidth, or the range of electromagnetic frequencies used, is usually a huge bottleneck in microwave imaging. Many devices operate in microwaves — ranging from microwave ovens to reconnaissance radars. When using a large bandwidth for microwave imaging, we increase the chances of interfering with other devices. Wide bandwidth also usually increases the complexity and cost of the devices. Further, in the case of imaging through surfaces, using wideband electromagnetic waves can cause image distortion.Using a single frequency, or a very narrow bandwidth, solves the problems associated with wide bandwidth, which is where my research comes into play. Reconfigurable metamaterials provide a simple means to realize imaging systems that use a single frequency.Q: What is innovative about your approach to developing imaging technology?A: The innovation at the heart of using metamaterials to obtain diverse measurements comes from the application of computational imaging. In this framework, computational post-processing is used to retrieve the desired image instead of relying solely on hardware components.This change of roles has immense benefits in terms of imaging speed and hardware complexity, and it allows us to use unconventional hardware such as metamaterials.Q: Can you “see” through walls with this technology?A: Seeing through layers has always been a fascinating idea in science fiction. However, that is not quite what is possible when we use microwave imaging to see through opaque layers. The resulting images may not easily be interpretable by the human eye but the measurements they produce carry a lot of information.The images obtained using microwave imaging can be used to examine structural integrity, detect structural damages, such as water leaks and cracks; locate items of interest, such as pipes or studs; or find and count the number of humans beyond walls, for example, in rescue operations. You can also use microwave imaging to inspect packages or backpacks, for example, to detect concealed threats.Q: How can microwave imaging technology be used to ensure infrastructure is safe?A: Microwave imaging enables nondestructive and usually noncontact evaluation and monitoring of different layers of infrastructure.It can even provide information about optically invisible layers. For example, it can detect cracks that may be invisible to the eye or provide information about a crack’s depth. If we can make a microwave imaging system more easily deployable and portable, it can be used in a range of applications, like examining building integrity and aiding restoration and repair projects.Q: How can it be used in search and rescue operations?A: Microwaves are reflected by the human body, but they go through most other optically opaque layers, such as buildings and fabric. That means a microwave imaging device can in principle locate a person by “looking through” walls or wreckage in disasters such as earthquakes, building collapses or fires. To bring these potentials to widespread use, we need to improve the speed and size of microwave imaging systems, as well as associated image processing techniques.Q: How else could this imaging technology improve people’s lives?A: If we can speed up data acquisition, we can eliminate the need for the stop-and-go process used currently at airports. Microwave imaging can be used in crowded places like stadiums, train stations, schools, hospitals and more as a simple and fast security screening device. As passengers pass through a corridor, the microwave imaging system can detect suspicious objects. Keep in mind that microwave imaging can also see through backpacks and luggage. Fast and affordable microwave imaging may thus detect potential threats concealed in backpacks in crowded areas, without requiring everyone to take them off.On a domestic basis, a fast and deployable microwave imaging system can be used in DIY projects, repairs, inspections or just for fun. When starting a DIY home improvement project, or doing an inspection of a house, one wants to know about the material behind walls, roofs or ceilings. For example, has the insulation settled down? Is there water leakage? Is there a pipe or wire behind the wall I am about to drill into? An affordable microwave camera can provide the answers to such problems.One can also just use the microwave camera for fun applications, such as checking how your foot fits within a shoe or discovering the contents of your gifts before opening them.Top image courtesy of Pexels.]]>",post_date:"09/01/2021-10:37am",clas_teaser:'Mohammadreza Imani is advancing microwave imaging by using uniquely patterned metamaterials for a faster and simpler way to "see" through barriers.',teaser:"",story_images:"",hero_image:"https://news.asu.edu/sites/default/files/styles/asu_news_article_hero/public/article_heros/imani_microwaveinfrastructurepexelssm.jpg?itok=WThAcmLP",path:"https://news.asu.edu/20210901-solutions-asu-engineer-harnesses-microwaves-improve-imaging-systems",hide_byline:"0","contributor-contact-information-affiliation":"Ira A.
